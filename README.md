# Implementing Polynomial Addition and Subtraction Using Linked Lists

### Project Objectives

* Representing a Univariate Polynomial of Degree n Using Linked Lists, Implement Polynomial Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication Operations. Further Extend to Support Calculations for m-variable Polynomials of Degree n.

### Specific Requirements
1. Implement a console-style interface.
2. The program interface displays a menu with operation numbers:
   * 1 for polynomial input,
   * 2 for polynomial addition (+),
   * 3for polynomial subtraction (-),
   * 4 for polynomial multiplication (*),
   * 5 for polynomial output,
   * and 0 to exit.
   * Use corresponding functions to perform specific operations.
3. Utilize modular design with multiple files, ensuring a clear program structure with well-commented code.
4. Write detailed design and implementation documentation.
